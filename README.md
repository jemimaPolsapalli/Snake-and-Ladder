# Snake-and-Ladder

The code simulates a Snakes and Ladders game for multiple players, with snakes and ladders positioned on a 100-square board. Players take turns rolling a dice (using the `roll_dice()` function) to move forward, and if they land on a snake, they slide back, while landing on a ladder moves them forward. The `play_game()` function controls the gameplay, with each player moving based on their dice roll and adjusting positions if they land on snakes or ladders. The first player to reach or exceed square 100 wins the game. The code runs 100 games for each number of players between 2 and 10, storing the number of wins for each player using a `defaultdict`. After all the games are simulated, it prints out the results, showing how many times each player won in each player configuration. The randomness in dice rolls ensures each gameâ€™s outcome is unpredictable, providing insights into how winning chances may vary with different numbers of players.
